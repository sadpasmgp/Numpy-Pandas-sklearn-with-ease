   "source": [
    "#### Statistics for data preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical methods are required in the development of train and test data for your machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes techniques for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Outlier detection\n",
    "    Missing value imputation\n",
    "    Data sampling\n",
    "    Data scaling\n",
    "    Variable encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outlier detection: \n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier is considered an observation that appears to deviate from other observations in the sample\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the range and distribution of attribute values in the input data. Outliers in input data can skew and mislead the training process of machine learning algorithms resulting in longer training times, less accurate models and ultimately more mediocre results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of potential outliers is vital for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier could indicate the data is bad. In example, the data maybe coded incorrectly, or the experiment did not run correctly. If it can be determined that an outlying point is, in fact, erroneous, then the value that is outlying should be removed from the analysis. If it is possible to correct that is another option\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few cases, it may not be possible to determine whether an outlying point is a bad data point. Outliers could be due to random variation or could possibly indicate something scientifically interesting. In any event, you typically do not want to just delete the outlying observation. However, if the data contains significant outliers, you may need to consider the use of robust statistical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Missing value imputation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the datasets now suffer from the problem of missing values. Your machine learning model may not get trained effectively if the data that you are feeding to the model contains missing values. Statistical tools and techniques come here for the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people tend to discard the data instances which contain a missing value. But that is not a good practice because during that course you may lose essential features/representations of the data. Although there are advanced methods for dealing with missing value problems, these are the quick techniques that one would go for: Mean Imputation and Median Imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is considered the currency of applied machine learning. Therefore, its collection and usage both are equally significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sampling refers to statistical methods for selecting observations from the domain with the objective of estimating a population parameter. In other words, sampling is an active process of gathering observations with the intent of estimating a population variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of a dataset represents an observation that is indicative of a particular population. When working with data, you often do not have access to all possible observations. This could be for many reasons, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It may be difficult or expensive to make more observations.\n",
    "    It may be challenging to gather all the observations together.\n",
    "    More observations are expected to be made in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, you will not have the right proportion of the data samples. So, you will have to under-sample or over-sample based on the type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You perform under-sampling when the data samples for a particular category are very high compared to other meaning you discard some of the data samples from the category where they are higher. You perform over-sampling when the data samples for a particular type are decidedly lower compared to the other. In this case, you generate data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to multi-class scenarios as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical sampling is a large field of study, but in applied machine learning, there may be three types of sampling that you are likely to use: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simple Random Sampling: Samples are drawn with a uniform probability from the domain.\n",
    "    Systematic Sampling: Samples are drawn using a pre-specified pattern, such as at intervals.\n",
    "    Stratified Sampling: Samples are drawn within pre-specified categories (i.e., strata).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the features of your dataset may widely vary in ranges. Some features may have a scale of 0 to 100 while the other may have ranges of 0.01 - 0.001, 10000- 20000, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very problematic for efficient modeling. Because a small change in the feature which has a lower value range than the other feature may not have a significant impact on those other features. It affects the process of good learning. Dealing with this problem is known as data scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different data scaling techniques such as Min-Max scaling, Absolute scaling, Standard scaling, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Variable encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, your datasets contain a mixture of both numeric and non-numeric data. Many machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn expect all the data to be present in all numeric format. This is also helpful to speed up the computation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques like Label encoding, One-Hot encoding, etc. are used to convert non-numeric data to numeric."

For example, before performing sentiment analysis of twitter data, you may want to strip out any html tags, white spaces, expand abbreviations and split the tweets into lists of the words they contain. When analyzing spatial data you may scale it so that it is unit-independent, that is, so that your algorithm doesn't care whether the original measurements were in miles or centimeters"

    "Let's say that we have some labeled data, for example, data that consists of characteristics of red wine (e.g. alcohol content, density, amount of citric acid, pH, etc...; these are the predictor variables) with target variable 'Quality' and labels 'good' & 'bad'. Then, given the characteristics of a new, unlabeled wine, the classification task is to predict its 'Quality'. When all the predictor variables are numerical (there are also ways to deal with the categorical case), we can consider each row/wine as a point in n-dimensional space and, in this case, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a conceptually & computationally simple classification method: for each new, unlabeled wine, we calculate, for some integer k, its k nearest neighbors in the n-dimensional predictor variable space. Then we look at the labels of these k neighbors (i.e. 'good' or 'bad') & assign the label with the most hits to the new wine (e.g. if k = 5, 3 neighbors vote 'good' and 2 vote 'bad', then our model labels the new wine 'good'). Note that, here, training the model consists entirely in storing the data points: there are no parameters to fit!"

    "First notice the range of the predictor variables: 'free sulfur dioxide' ranges from 0 to ~70 and 'volatile acidity' from ~0 to ~1.2. More specifically, the former has a range 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the latter. Any algorithm, such as k-NN, which cares about the distance between data points, may thus focus squarely and unfairly on variables with a larger range, such as 'free sulfur dioxide', a variable that may contain only noise, for all we know. This motivates scaling our data"

Remember that we want a model that generalizes well to new data. Thus, if we train our model on a dataset D, reporting the accuracy of the model on the same data D may make it look as though it performs better than it actually does. This is known as overfitting. To combat this issue, data scientists will commonly train their model on a subset of the data, called the training set and evaluate its performance on the rest of the data, the test set. This is precisely what we're going to do here! A general rule of thumb is to use approximately 80% of the data for training & 20% for test. Let's now split our red wine quality data:"
