    "    Train your model on k-1 folds (e.g. the first 9 folds).\n",
    "    Evaluate it on the remaining \"hold-out\" fold (e.g. the 10th fold).\n",
    "    Perform steps (2) and (3) k times, each time holding out a different fold.\n",
    "    Aggregate the performance across all k folds. This is your performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold Cross-Validation diagram, courtesy of Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is cross-validation important in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to train a random forest regressor. One of the hyperparameters you must tune is the maximum depth allowed for each decision tree in your forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you decide?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where cross-validation comes in. Using only your training set, you can use CV to evaluate different hyperparameters and estimate their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to keep your test set \"untainted\" and save it for a true hold-out evaluation when you're finally ready to select a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can use CV to tune a random forest model, a linear regression model, and a k-nearest neighbors model, using only the training set. Then, you still have the untainted test set to make your final selection between the model families!\n",
    "\n",
    "So WTF is a cross-validation \"pipeline?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The best practice when performing CV is to include your data preprocessing steps inside the cross-validation loop. This prevents accidentally tainting your training folds with influential data from your test fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the CV pipeline looks after including preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Split your data into k equal parts, or \"folds\" (typically k=10).\n",
    "    Preprocess k-1 training folds.\n",
    "    Train your model on the same k-1 folds.\n",
    "    Preprocess the hold-out fold using the same transformations from step (2).\n",
    "    Evaluate your model on the same hold-out fold.\n",
    "    Perform steps (2) - (5) k times, each time holding out a different fold.\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, it's really that easy. GridSearchCV essentially performs cross-validation across the entire \"grid\" (all possible permutations) of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes in your model (in this case, we're using a model pipeline), the hyperparameters you want to tune, and the number of folds to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, there's a lot going on under the hood. We've included the pseudo-code above, and we'll cover writing cross-validation from scratch in a separate guide.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Tip: It turns out that in practice, random forests don't actually require a lot of tuning. They tend to work pretty well out-of-the-box with a reasonable number of trees. Even so, these same steps can be used when building any type of supervised learning model.\n",
    "Step 8: Refit on the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've tuned your hyperparameters appropriately using cross-validation, you can generally get a small performance improvement by refitting the model on the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",

    "Great, so now the question is... is this performance good enough?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the rule of thumb is that your very first model probably won't be the best possible model. However, we recommend a combination of three strategies to decide if you're satisfied with your model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Start with the goal of the model. If the model is tied to a business problem, have you successfully solved the problem?\n",
    "    Look in academic literature to get a sense of the current performance benchmarks for specific types of data.\n",
    "    Try to find low-hanging fruit in terms of ways to improve your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to improve a model. We'll have more guides that go into detail about how to improve model performance, but here are a few quick things to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Try other regression model families (e.g. regularized regression, boosted trees, etc.).\n",
    "    Collect more data if it's cheap to do so.\n",
    "    Engineer smarter features after spending more time on exploratory analysis.\n",
    "    Speak to a domain expert to get more context (...this is a good excuse to go wine tasting!).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, when you try other families of models, we recommend using the same training and test set as you used to fit the random forest model. That's the best way to get a true apples-to-apples comparison between your models.\n",
    "Step 10: Save model for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job completing this tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "You've done the hard part, and deserve another glass of wine. Maybe this time you can use your shiny new predictive model to select the bottle.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before you go, let's save your hard work so you can use the model in the future. It's really easy to do so:\n",
    "Save model to a .pkl file\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "joblib.dump(clf, 'rf_regressor.pkl')\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it. When you want to load the model again, simply use this function:\n",
    "Load model from .pkl file\n",
    "\t\n",
    "clf2 = joblib.load('rf_regressor.pkl')\n",
    " \n",
    "    # Predict data set using loaded model\n",
    "clf2.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, you've reached the end of this tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "We've just completed a whirlwind tour of Scikit-Learn's core functionality, but we've only really scratched the surface. Hopefully you've gained some guideposts to further explore all that sklearn has to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For continued learning, we recommend studying other examples in sklearn.\n",
    "The complete code, from start to finish.\n",
